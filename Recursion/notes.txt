Function is the main pillar of recursion
function is a mehtod where some particluar task is done
Example:
    we are swaping elements
        temp = arr[0]
        arr[0] = arr[1]
        arr[1] = temp
    let say this operation is carried on various places instead of repeating this line everytime 
    we can write this in a function and we can use it whenever we need it


Example for recursion:
    lets say, this is your paper distribution time, so students are sitting in 4 rows
    one way is teacher distributing paper from first to last row and collecting it back
    another way is passing the answer sheets from first students to second row and vice versa
    this second way concept is used in recursion.

    Diagram for paper distribution analogy:
        Teacher → Row 1 → Row 2 → Row 3 → Row 4
                ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓
                (pass)   (pass)   (pass)   (pass)

        Collecting back (reverse):
        Row 4 → Row 3 → Row 2 → Row 1 → Teacher
        ↑        ↑        ↑        ↑
        (pass)  (pass)   (pass)   (pass)

        This "passing" from one row to the next is like recursion:
        - Each student (row) passes the paper to the next (recursive call).
        - When the last student gets the paper, the process reverses (returns back through the calls).

In recursion there must be a base condition
