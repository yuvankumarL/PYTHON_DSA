what is the use of this?
    let say you have 2 systems A and B. In system A your code runs within 0.5 sec, but in system B it takes 
    1 sec.
    When you run your code on different computers, it might take different amounts of time. 
    For example, on computer A it takes 0.5 seconds, and on computer B it takes 1 second. 
    This happens because computers have different speeds.
    Time complexity helps you understand how your code will perform as the input gets bigger, 
    no matter which computer you use. It tells you how much slower your code will get if you give 
    it more data, not just how fast it runs on one computer.

    Space complexity is about how much memory (RAM) your code needs to run, 
    depending on the size of the input. Just like time complexity tells you 
    how the running time grows as you give more data, space complexity tells you 
    how the memory usage grows as the input gets bigger. This helps you understand if your code 
    will use too much memory when working with large amounts of data, no matter which computer you use.
