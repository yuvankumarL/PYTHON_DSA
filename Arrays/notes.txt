Arrays:
    Same datatype
    static datatype
    contiguous memory

4 operations:
    1. access - using index value
        complexity: o(1)
    2. insert 
        complexity: best case O(1) - eg., insert value at last
                    worst case O(n-i) - eg., insert value inbetween the array, because after inserting the 
                                        value in ith place, the value next to the i+1th place to n-1 is 
                                        shifted right.
    3. delete
        complexity: worst case O(n-i) - eg., delete value inbetween the array, because after deleting the 
                                        value in ith place, the value from to the i+1th place to n-1 is 
                                        shifted left.
                    best case O(1) - eg., delete value at last
    4. search
        complexity: best case O(1) - eg., if the element present in the first index
                    worst case o(n) - eg., if the element present in last index

mainly data structure is choosen based on the above 4 operations
We will choose it based on the time complexity required for these 4 operations
